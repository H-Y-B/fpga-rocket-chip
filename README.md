# Step-by-step Guide of Booting linux on a Rocket-chip SoC on Nexys4ddr

## I. Big Map

The main idea of this guide is to provide a step-by-step tutorial of building a **RISC-V** SoC, especially for those who are interested in the **Rocket-chip** and want to test it on a real board instead of simulators. At the end of the tutorial, you will be able to boot a Linux on the **Nexys4ddr** FPGA board and run your own riscv programs on it.

A general background is provided by the following links: [RISC-V](https://riscv.org) and [Rocket-Chip](https://github.com/freechipsproject/rocket-chip).

### 1.1 How a Linux gets booted

![system structure](pics/bigmap.png)

The **ExampleRocketSystem** generated by Rocket-chip is the top module that we will adopt to build our system. It exposes a MIMO-AXI4 and a Mem-AXI4 interfaces to the outside peripherals, of which the former will be connected to IO devices including **Uart**(@0x60000000), **SDslot**(@0x60020000) and **BRAM_64K**(@0x60010000) and the latter will be used to connect **DDR**(@0x80000000) memory.

Here is the whole story of the booting procedure: 

- After power on, the PC (program counter) is set to 0x10040 according to the variable **Reset_Vector**. The processor starts executing  instructings in **TLBootrom**(@0x10000) inside of ExampleRocketChip. TLBootrom contains instrcutions asking the processor jumping to BRAM_64K: `li s0, BRAM_BASE`, ` jr s0`.
- In the **BRAM_64K**, two tasks of our **first stage bootloader** (aka FSBL) are accomplished: to copy the elf image, which contains a **BBL** (Berkeley bootloader) and a **vmlinux** image to somewhere (@0x870000000) in the DDR, and to extract this elf onto the beginning of DDR(@0x80000000). Following the two tasks, the FSBL will jump to DDR and the PC will move to the bbl:  `li s0, DDR_BASE`, ` jr s0`.
- In the DDR, BBL will do some preparation works, including setting traps, SBI (supervisor binary interface) and physical memory protection, and then handing over a DTB (device tree blob) to the kernel (in early versions, BBL also virtualizes the memory, which is now directly handled by the Linux). Ultimately, BBL starts the Linux kernel: `enter_supervisor_mode(entry, hartid, dub_output())`.
- After the initialization of the kernel, **busybox_init** starts and calls the **busybox_ash**, which provides you with a command line interface.

### 1.2 basic knowledge required

- Make and Makefile
- How codes turn into machine instructions
- C and Assembly language
- Operating System
- Hardware design experience

### 1.3 repo preparation

Download the source files:

`git clone https://github.com/cnrv/fpga-rocket-chip -b nexys4-demo`

` git submodule update --init --recursive`

There are several dirs in the repo:

- **constrains**, **verilog**, **firmware** - those are sources that we will use to build Vivado project and FPGA configration file, namely, mcs. Firmware contains the SDloader program that load elf image into DDR, functioning as a FSBL.
- **riscv-pk** - a modified verison of [riscv/riscv-pk](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-pk) repo. We plant the DTB into the bbl and slightly change the uart driver. Generally DTB should be located in the firmware, but for debugging convenience (it is time consuming to change the firmware and reburn it into FPGA), I put it just inside the bbl.

Besides, you also need to download the following repos:

- **cross compiler** - `git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain` 

- **linux kernel** -  ` git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-linux` 

- **busybox** that provides init and utils - `git clone https://github.com/mirror/busybox` 

## II. Hardware generation

**Vivado** version 2016.4; **Ubuntu** version 16 LTS

The tutorial should work well for most version of vivado.

Also, do not forget to install **vivado usb driver**, in case the Hardware Manager cannot recognize the board.

- Tools - Generate Memory Configuartion File
  - Format - MCS; Memory Part - s25fl128sxxxxxx0-spi; Interface - SPIx1
  - Do not forget to specify a filename and the output path
  - Check Load bitstream files - select  **your_project_dir/.runs/impl_1/.bit**

- Then you can find a ***.mcs** file under the path you specify in the Filename Option.
- Hardware Manager - add configuration memory device - s25fl128sxxxxxx0-spi
- Hardware Window - program configuration memory device
  - select your *.mcs file as configuration file
  - Apply

- Or if you wish you could use **Program Device** that sending bitstream to FPGA through USB directly, in which case, you need to program FPGA manually everytime you poweroff it.
